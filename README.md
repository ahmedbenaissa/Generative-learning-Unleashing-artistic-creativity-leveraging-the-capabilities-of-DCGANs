# Generative-learning-Unleashing-artistic-creativity-leveraging-the-capabilities-of-DCGANs

### This project is an academic project created by: Ismail Said / Ahmed Ben Aissa / Amine Chaabini
### In this project we are going to use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) to generate 3 types of images:

###  
### - Artwork from the most known artists 
#### using this dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time]

###  
### - Landscape images
#### using this dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/landscape-pictures]


###  
### - Clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset 
#### using this dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist]
# 
#### In the folder 'notebooks' we have 3 notebooks each containing the code for the generation of one of the 3 types of images listed above
#### As an example; here is the progression of the training on the fashion MNIST dataset

### You can also find a video of the progression of the landscape dataset in the 'training_progress_videos' folder
#### (All generated images are 64x64)
#   
#### We have also created a Graphical user interface in which you can choose a type of images and generate a grid of images of that type. the GUI was created with Tkinter and it used the models' checkpoints stored as state dictionaries in pth files that you can find in the 'modelCheckPoints' folder.
